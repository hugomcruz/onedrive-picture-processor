# onedrive-picture-processor

The objective of this script is processing the inbound folder on OneDrive
 


Requires the following modules:
- onedrive-simple-sdk-python (https://github.com/hugomcruz/onedrive-simple-sdk-python) - It is not a python package as of now. Must be installed manually
- ffproble-hcruz (Based on ffprobe-python but due to bugs on this, I created a fork.
- ExifRead (v 2.3.2)
- Pillow (v 8.2.0)
